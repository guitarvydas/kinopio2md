control flow is not data

- control flow is interpretation of data - dynamic flow
  - a CPU is an interpreter
  - a CPU interprets opcodes
  - a CPU interprets opcodes so quickly that we think of it as something other than interpretation
- data is static - and is not interpreted by the underlying system
  - static data is interpreted by the program, not the CPU
